      <description>For my honours project (for more details, check the &amp;lsquo;Projects&amp;rsquo; tab), I needed to build a program that would scrape Twitter/X for tweets. This was done using the snscrape library and Python. This project also had a front-end interface in order to give the program inputs instead of doing it through the CLI.&#xA;The program takes in the number of total tweets wanted and what hashtag you want the scraper to crawl through to collect them.</description>

      <description>There are many different types of data visulisations. However, a skilled data analyst will use the most effective type of visulisation to visually aid the &amp;lsquo;storytelling&amp;rsquo; / what story the data shows. Not only do suitable data vcisulisations aid in this, but bad choices for data visulisations can mislead an audience to believing falsehoods or just confuse them.&#xA;The following graph is the standard &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; visulisation - looking at the graph below, what do you immediately infer about gun deaths in Florida?</description>

      <description>I undertook my honours during my fourth year of university. In my research project, I wanted to experiment with different types of dataset collection and preprocessing methodologies and how they affected the performance of Topic models (a type of AI model).&#xA;The goal of a topic model is to summarise a long piece of text/s by examining the co-occurrence patterns of words and organising the words it sees into a &amp;rsquo;topic&#39;.</description>
