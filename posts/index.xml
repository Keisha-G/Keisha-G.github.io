      <description>For my honours project (for more details, check the &amp;lsquo;Projects&amp;rsquo; tab), I needed to build a program that would scrape Twitter/X for tweets. This was done using the snscrape library and Python.

Not only do suitable data vcisulisations aid in this, but bad choices for data visulisations can mislead an audience to believing falsehoods or just confuse them.&#xA;The following graph is the standard &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; visulisation - looking at the graph below, what do you immediately infer about gun deaths in Florida?</description>
