      <description>With the increasing amount of commercial use of machine learning (ML) systems, these systems&amp;rsquo; fairness and unbiased nature become an issue of vital importance. These systems are being employed to make decisions that are usually protected by anti-discrimination laws and, thus, unmonitored, are having an adverse effect on society. The interest in this field is not just one of social importance but also one of utility. A bias based unfairly on protected characteristics instead of other attributes would not result in the most efficient, &amp;lsquo;merit-based&amp;rsquo; outcome.</description>
